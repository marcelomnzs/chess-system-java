## Chess-System-Java

Project made to practice and develop my Java skills. This was made during my learning process using the Nelio Alves Java Course!

## How to run:

- Just clone the repo normally, and run in your console or IDE of preference. It's a simple version of a chess game using the console to play!

### Have fun ;)
